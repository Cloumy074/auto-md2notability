# This project is under construction...  

#### - About Cloumy: First time trying to use Rust, still learning, I know it has a lot of bugs. I'll learn the basic knowledge step by step by constructing this program. 
#### - About this project: Made because I need to convert my markdown notes into pdfs then auto sync to notability (So I can review them and add handwritten notes when needed)
#### - About... : Whatever I just needed an README file so it doesn't seem empty.
